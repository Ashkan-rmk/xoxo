This app just coded to test some features like making differents intents to moving between activities.

woking with material design and some animating classes and a light database(Shared Prefrences).

In this app by scanning your fingerprint(fun!) it will calculate the love percentages between two persons.

Hope will be FUN!

For use this source code you will have to copy/paste classes from app directory into android studio,

then copy/paste android manifest.xml from main directory.
